*Steganography*
: Hiding Data in Plain Sight
Steganography is a hacking technique that's both fascinating and mysterious. It involves hiding data within images, audio, or videos without anyone noticing.

What is Steganography?
Steganography is an old concept where secret messages are embedded within normal files. In modern hacking, sensitive data (like payloads, keys, or confidential information) is hidden within image, audio, or video pixels.

How Does it Work?
Imagine having an *image file* that looks normal but contains secret code or malware.

There are several techniques:

1. *Least Significant Bit (LSB) Technique*: Image pixels are read one by one, and the last bit (which is negligible) is modified to embed data.
2. *Audio/Video Steganography*: Data is hidden in unused spaces (metadata or noise) within audio or video files.
3. *Tools for Steganography*: Steghide, OpenStego, and ExifTool are popular tools used for steganography.

Practical Example
Let's say you have an image (`spoiler.jpg`) and want to hide a secret text file (`Meta-Payload.txt`). You can use Steghide to embed the file:

```
bash
steghide embed -cf spoiler.jpg -ef Meta-Payload.txt
```

Now, the message is hidden within the image.

Uses of Steganography
1. *Secure Communication*: Confidential data can be shared without arousing suspicion.
2. *Malware Distribution*: Hackers distribute malicious payloads within images.
3. *Digital Watermarking*: Steganography is used for copyright protection.

How to Detect Steganography?
1. *Histogram Analysis*: Abnormal changes in the image histogram can indicate hidden data.
2. *Steganalysis Tools*: Tools like Stegdetect or StegSecret can detect steganography.

How to Stay Secure?
1. *Validate Downloads*: Check the integrity of downloaded files.
2. *Encryption + Steganography*: Use encryption and steganography for double security.
