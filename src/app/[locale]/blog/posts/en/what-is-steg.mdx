_Steganography_
: Hiding Data in Plain Sight
Steganography is a hacking technique that's both fascinating and mysterious. It involves hiding data within images, audio, or videos without anyone noticing.

What is Steganography?
Steganography is an old concept where secret messages are embedded within normal files. In modern hacking, sensitive data (like payloads, keys, or confidential information) is hidden within image, audio, or video pixels.

How Does it Work?
Imagine having an _image file_ that looks normal but contains secret code or malware.

There are several techniques:

1. _Least Significant Bit (LSB) Technique_: Image pixels are read one by one, and the last bit (which is negligible) is modified to embed data.
2. _Audio/Video Steganography_: Data is hidden in unused spaces (metadata or noise) within audio or video files.
3. _Tools for Steganography_: Steghide, OpenStego, and ExifTool are popular tools used for steganography.

Practical Example
Let's say you have an image (`spoiler.jpg`) and want to hide a secret text file (`Meta-Payload.txt`). You can use Steghide to embed the file:

```
bash
steghide embed -cf spoiler.jpg -ef Meta-Payload.txt
```

Now, the message is hidden within the image.

Uses of Steganography

1. _Secure Communication_: Confidential data can be shared without arousing suspicion.
2. _Malware Distribution_: Hackers distribute malicious payloads within images.
3. _Digital Watermarking_: Steganography is used for copyright protection.

How to Detect Steganography?

1. _Histogram Analysis_: Abnormal changes in the image histogram can indicate hidden data.
2. _Steganalysis Tools_: Tools like Stegdetect or StegSecret can detect steganography.

How to Stay Secure?

1. _Validate Downloads_: Check the integrity of downloaded files.
2. _Encryption + Steganography_: Use encryption and steganography for double security.
