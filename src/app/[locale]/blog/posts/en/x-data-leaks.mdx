Twitter (X) Faces Unprecedented Data Leak: 2.8 Billion User Profiles Exposed  

A massive data leak involving 2.87 billion Twitter (X) profiles has surfaced on Breach Forums, allegedly orchestrated by a disgruntled ex-employee amid company layoffs. If true, this could be the largest social media data breach in history.  

### What We Know  
A forum user, "ThinkingOne," claims to have obtained 400GB of user profile data, allegedly stolen during X’s restructuring. Despite multiple attempts to alert the company, there has been no response from X. Frustrated, the leaker combined this data with a previous 2023 breach, creating a merged dataset.  

### What’s Inside the 2025 Leak?  
Unlike the 2023 breach, which exposed emails, this dataset contains:  
- Account creation dates  
- User IDs, screen names, and profile descriptions  
- Location and time zone settings  
- Follower counts (2021 & 2025)  
- Tweet history, including timestamps and app sources  
- Profile verification and status settings  

This provides a deep snapshot of users' profiles and activity over time. However, no email addresses are included in the new leak.  

### The Numbers Don’t Add Up  
With X having around 335.7 million users as of early 2025, the claim of 2.8 billion records raises questions. Possible explanations include merged historical data, inactive or deleted accounts, and bot profiles. Some entries may also originate from external sources rather than X itself.  

### Silence from X  
Despite the scale of the leak, X has yet to acknowledge the breach. Whether it was an insider attack or aggregated from various sources, the incident raises serious concerns about data security and transparency.
