# How to view saved Wi‑Fi passwords in Kali Linux

> **Quick note:** This tutorial shows how NetworkManager stores connection profiles and how to read them. You **must** have `sudo` (root) access to view these files. Only inspect networks you own or have explicit permission to audit.

I just discovered a simple and reliable way to find saved Wi‑Fi passwords on a Linux system that uses NetworkManager (this includes Kali Linux). It's technical, but straightforward if you follow the steps below.

---

## What you're looking for

NetworkManager stores connection profiles at:

```bash
/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/
```

Each saved connection is a file (often with extension `.nmconnection` or no visible extension) that contains a `[wifi-security]` section. The password is usually stored under the `psk` key.

---

## Step-by-step

1. Open a terminal.
2. Change to the directory that holds connection profiles:

```bash
cd /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/
```

3. List the available connection files:

```bash
ls -l
# or (show hidden if any)
ls -la
```

4. View the connection file you want (replace `WIFI_SSID_Name` with the exact filename):

```bash
sudo cat 'WIFI_SSID_Name'
# e.g. sudo cat 'W3B.nmconnection' or sudo cat 'W3B'
```

When prompted, enter your sudo password.

You should see a file that looks like this :

```ini
[connection]
id=W3B
uuid=0a06ac9d-1937-183e-a173-01c02284e739
type=wifi
interface-name=wlan0

[wifi]
mode=infrastructure
ssid=W3B

[wifi-security]
auth-alg=open
key-mgmt=wpa-psk
psk=THISisTHEpsw
```

> The value after `psk=` is the Wi‑Fi password (pre‑shared key).

---

## Faster alternatives

If you want to search all stored profiles for passwords in one go:

```bash
# show all lines containing 'psk=' in every profile (requires sudo)
sudo grep -H "psk=" /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/*
```

Or using `nmcli` to show a specific connection (might still require root depending on permissions):

```bash
sudo nmcli connection show "W3B" | sed -n '1,200p'
# or to show secrets (some NetworkManager versions require --show-secrets):
sudo nmcli connection show "W3B" --show-secrets
```

## Security & legal warning

- **Only** use this method on machines and networks you own or are authorized to audit.
- Viewing saved passwords requires root privileges — treat them sensitively.
- Many modern setups encrypt these files or protect secrets; your system settings and distribution may be different.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you get `Permission denied`, make sure you used `sudo` or that your account is in the `sudoers` file.
- If a profile file is encrypted or missing `psk=`, the password may be stored in a keyring (e.g., GNOME Keyring) or managed elsewhere.
