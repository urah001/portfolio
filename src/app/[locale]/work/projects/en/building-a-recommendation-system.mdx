## **Overview**

The project idea emerged from the growing need to personalize students' dietary options and ensure those with specific health conditions (e.g., diabetes, ulcers, allergies) can access safe, nutritious meals easily. The system creates a digital profile for each student and uses collected data to recommend meals through an online food ordering platform. It serves not only as a convenience tool but also as a smart dietary assistant.

The recommendation system is built using **collaborative filtering** techniques, which analyze patterns among students with similar preferences or conditions to suggest the suitable meals. It also takes advantage of student profile data (e.g., age, medical condition, dietary preference) to fine-tune results.

## **Challenges and Learnings**

### **Challenges:**

- üí° **Data Collection**: Getting real student dietary and health data for model training was difficult due to privacy and availability concerns.
- üß† **Building an Accurate Recommendation Engine**: Implementing collaborative filtering and training the model to yield meaningful suggestions took significant trial and error.
- üé® **UI/UX Design**: Designing an interface that feels welcoming and intuitive to students, while also handling complex states (like dietary restrictions), was a challenge.

### **Learnings:**

- Gained deep insight into how machine learning can be integrated into real-world applications.
- Learned to manage a full-stack project with ML components.
- Understood the importance of user-centric design, especially when health and personalization are involved.
- Improved skills in Next.js and working with responsive, dynamic layouts.

## **Outcome**

SmartBite successfully delivers a prototype that showcases how machine learning can enhance the food ordering experience for students. It offers a modern and responsive interface, smart recommendations, and a foundation for future extensions like calorie tracking or meal planning.

Though still in development, SmartBite represents a strong step towards combining machine learning with everyday student life and can potentially be expanded for universities, offices, or even hospital canteens.
