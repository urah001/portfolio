title: "FarmerAI â€“ My first test in putting ML in web development"
publishedAt: "2025-09-26"
summary: " Farming goes beyond planting crops , itâ€™s about making informed decisions in every step of the way. To support this, I built a **Farmer Management System** that combines **machine learning** and **real-time weather forecasting**. It provides farmers with insights to improve crop choices, detect diseases early , and plan with accurate weather updates both weather and wind."

# ðŸŒ± Building a Farmer Management System with Machine Learning

---

## **Overview**

The system combines several intelligent features into a single platform:

1. **Dashboard** â€“ A central hub that displays ML results for crop recommendation, disease detection and weather weather forecasts in a simple and intuitive interface.

2. **Crop Recommendation System** â€“ Trained with a **Random Forest Classifier (RFC)** in Python, it predicts the most suitable crop to plant using soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, rainfall, and pH values. Thanks to the large dataset, the model achieved an **accuracy of 99.86%**.

3. **Disease Detection System** â€“ Built with machine learning, this feature helps identify crop diseases from plant images, reducing risks and improving crop health.

4. **Weather Forecast System** â€“ Connected to a weather API, it provides real-time forecasts to help farmers plan effectively.

This integrations /features ensures that farmers donâ€™t just get dataâ€”they get insights they can act on.

## **Key Features**

- **Dashboard View**: Clear, easy-to-understand results and forecasts.
- **Crop Recommendation**: Suggests crops with **99.86% accuracy** using RFC.
- **Disease Detection**: Detects plant diseases with ML image classification.
- **Weather Forecasting**: Provides live weather updates through an API.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)** â€“ ML model building and data analysis.
- **Random Forest Classifier (RFC)** â€“ For crop recommendation.
- **Teachable Machine / TensorFlow** â€“ For plant disease detection.
- **Next.js** â€“ Frontend framework for the web interface.
- **Flask API** â€“ Backend connection between ML models and the frontend.
- **Weather API** â€“ For real-time forecasts.

---

## **Challenges and Learning**

- **Integration**: Connecting multiple ML models with the frontend in a smooth way.
- **Data Handling**: Ensuring the large crop dataset was well-prepared for training.
- **Accuracy vs. Usability**: Making sure high-accuracy models still produced **clear, user-friendly outputs** for farmers.

Through this, I learned the importance of **clean data**, **API integration**, and building **user-centric dashboards**, and ML models.

## **Outcome**

The result is a **Farmer Management System** that acts like a digital farming assistant. It:
âœ… Helps farmers choose the best crop with near-perfect accuracy.
âœ… Detects crop diseases early, saving time and resources.
âœ… Delivers reliable weather forecasts for better planning.
âœ… Brings everything together in one intuitive dashboard.

This project proves how **machine learning and APIs can transform agriculture**, making it smarter, more efficient, and future-ready.
