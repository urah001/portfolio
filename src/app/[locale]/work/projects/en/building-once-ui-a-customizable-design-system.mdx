## Overview

I created a Web3 crypto site focused on showcasing my expertise in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. The platform integrates features like trading functionalities, user dashboards, and data visualizations. The goal was to build a professional and responsive site with interactive elements and efficient performance

## Key Features

    A visually appealing interface tailored for both desktop and mobile users.

-**Crypto Data Integration**:

    Display of real-time cryptocurrency prices and stats. json data and api needed for crypto price chart

-**Trading Functionalities**:

    Interactive elements for users to explore crypto assets and make informed decisions.

-**User Dashboard**:

    Allows users to view their portfolio and transaction history.

-**Web3 Integration**:

    Connects to blockchain wallets to enable decentralized interactions.


## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Styled-Components**: For styling React components with a modular, themable approach.
- **Storybook**: For building an interactive, documented component library.

## Challenges and Learnings
Permission Issues:
    Struggled with Linux file permissions and had to configure VS Code and directories for smoother workflow.

Server Management:

    Learned how to manage and integrate Next.js and PHP servers simultaneously using tools like XAMPP and concurrently.

Integration:

    Encountered difficulties linking the Next.js frontend with the PHP backend but resolved them by using APIs effectively.

Design Implementation:

    Learned how to translate complex designs from Figma to Tailwind CSS, ensuring consistency and responsiveness.

Web3 Complexity:

    Faced challenges understanding and implementing wallet connection features but gained confidence using ethers.js

## Outcome

Successfully built a responsive and feature-rich crypto website that integrates blockchain functionalities.
Improved your understanding of full-stack development by combining Next.js and PHP.
Gained valuable experience in addressing real-world challenges like API integrations, server management, and frontend-backend connectivity
