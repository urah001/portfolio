## **Overview**

This project idea has been with me since 2020 but i got the motivation to build it from my college entrepreneurship class , after the lecturer challenged us to create a business ourself or with a group of people , which i choose to create with a group of friends.

What brought about this unique idea was the increase need to help service renderer get customers who needs their services.
